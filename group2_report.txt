Task 2 achievement 
The task involved creating a bioruby class to extract information from a fasta file input that has been used by bepipred. The information collected by the class includes: sequence/s ID, Description, Length, sequence and number of sequences in the fasta file.

The importance of the extracted information is that:

1.  You can be able to associate the length of the sequence in relation to the number of epitopes
2.  You can quickly in glance know the number of sequences analysed
3.  You can easily obtain the actual sequence for ease of manipulation with other software that only require sequence in put without the inclusion of sequence details.  eg. T-coffee

The task though did not have much of a direct biological application.
